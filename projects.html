                    <h2>Artificial Intellienge</h2>
                </header>
            </div>
			<p>There are 2 projects i dedicatedly devloped in this domain under the sub category of computer vision and natural language processing.</p> 
				<p>Those 2 are 
					<ul><li>Real time censoring</li>
					<li>Emotion tweet detector </li></ul>
			<h3>1. Real time censoring</h3>
			<p>This project is pure work on my own and the findings how it possibke works or the way it works are founded purely logistical by the means of me.</p>
			<p><u>SCOPE</u> : The real scope of this project is to implement censor based system on streamming networks to convert the explicit contents on tv or any movies into family oriented content, Which could really come in handy when you are watching with family.
			<br><br><u>WORKING</u> : Working is simple as the censor work is done by three constraints
			<ul><li>When there is a explicit scene such as kiss scene or nude scene or cuss words, it gets trimed as seemless.</li>
			<li>When the explicit scene is much more important to movie or the turning point for the story, it gets auto CGI to make it more seemless. </li>
		<li>On the note of using the computer graphics it is basically reverse engineering the Deepfake algorithm.</li></ul>
				<p>How it's done is by the implementation of computer vision and NLP algorithms to learn more about it read my reasearch work on this here.</p>
			</p>
			<h3>2. Emotion tweet detector</h3>
			<p>I wouldn't say this project is purely devloped by me and as this is the learning phase of proof that I learnt in the field of Artificial Intellienge, this is an already exciting project under the emotion detection. </p>
			<p><u>SCOPE</u> : The scope is basically simple when we provide a particular tweet to the ML model, it ranges as in rate the tweet's emotional condition as positive, negative or neutral.</p>
			<p><u>WORKING</u> : Working is similar to Google's teachable machine as the required number of tweet data is given and trained the model to find the emotions on new tweets by finding and understanding of the data which the model used to learn.</p>
			<p>More about it can be found on my github page, checkout and mess with it as much you like.</p>

				<h2>Web Devlopment</h2>
			</header>
			
			<p>Starting from creating a simple web page design with the help of HTML, CSS and javascript I have honed my skills in web develpoment by learning through the development and depolyment all on my own since 2017  </p>
			<p>I could say this website one of the proof of learning but more can be opt on down, check it out please</p>
			
			<header class="major">
			<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
		</header>
			<p>I had no money to subscribe for cloud so I mostly relied on the free trial and learned most of the cloud on the specific time period with I worked on the specific services to to my particular need for my project. </p>
			<h3>Personal Virtual Private Network</h3>
			<p>As you may know VPN works by establishing a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, Here we are not relaying on any VPN provider as we are creating a remote server on our own by cloud computing services. </p>
			<p><u>WORKING</u> : For starters we are cretaing an Virtual machine on the Cloud server, it is called E2 Instance in AWS. Through we create a key pair for SSH access </p>
			<p>Now for the big part we are using the Opensource OpenVPN which creates a secure tunnel for data traffic to pass between the VPN client and server. Which makes its accessible so easy. </p>
			<p>Created an Blog on how to create process which can be also found on my Github too.</p>
			
			<header class="major">
			<h2>Operating System</h2></header>
			<h3>Smart Watch Open source OS - Project Kaizen</h3>
			<p>This project has been in my mind for a long and I am still expirementing on working with it, Everything right from the kernel development to frimware connection to OS building </p>
			<p>As everyone know about apple, google and samsung are on the top of the smart watch industry, The main point they are where they are is in the Wear industry is becasue the immense wide variety of options they are offering on the OS of those watches. Which ranges from offering all health related options on small system which is more optimized to work as fast and give accurated results on less likely hardware. </p>
			<p>The answer depend on the perfection of stuff they are doing is mainly because of the R&D which makes all of this possible. But what they are doing is mostly a closed source work as we never know the architecture on which the OS is built upon, This project which is an open source of building the OS with the ground architecture from building a customizable kernal to designing the user interface to deploying the the apps to it. </p>
