                    <h2>Artificial Intellienge</h2>
                </header>
            </div>
			<p>There are 2 projects i dedicatedly devloped in this domain under the sub category of computer vision and natural language processing.</p> 
				<p>Those 2 are 
					<ul><li>Real time censoring</li>
					<li>Emotion tweet detector </li></ul>
			<h3>1. Real time censoring</h3>
			<p>This project is solely work on my own and the findings, how it possibly works or the way it works are entirely determined by me.</p>
			<p><u>SCOPE</u> : The real scope of this project is to implement censor based system on streamming networks to convert the explicit contents on tv or any movies into family oriented content, Which could really come in handy when you are watching with family.
			<br><br><u>WORKING</u> : Working is made simple as the sensor's function is governed by three constraints. 
			<ul><li>When there is a explicit scene such as kiss scene or nude scene or cuss words, it gets trimed as seemless.</li>
			<li>If the explicit scene is pivotal to the movie or serves as a turning point in the story, it undergoes automatic CGI enhancement to seamlessly integrate it.  </li>
		<li>On the note of using the computer graphics it is basically reverse engineering the Deepfake algorithm.</li></ul>
				<p>How it's done is by the implementation of computer vision and NLP algorithms to learn more about it read my reasearch work on this here.</p>
			</p>
			<h3>2. Emotion tweet detector</h3>
			<p>I wouldn't say this project is solely developed by me. As part of my learning journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence, this project is an exciting endeavor focusing on emotion detection.</p>
			<p><u>SCOPE</u> : The scope is basically simple when we provide a particular tweet to the ML model, it ranges as in rate the tweet's emotional condition as positive, negative or neutral.</p>
			<p><u>WORKING</u> : The process resembles Google's Teachable Machine. We provide the necessary tweet data to train the model, enabling it to recognize emotions in new tweets based on the patterns it learned from the training data.</p>
			<p>More about it can be found on my github page, checkout and mess with it as much you like.</p>

				<h2>Web Devlopment</h2>
			</header>
			
			<p>Starting from creating a simple web page design with the help of HTML, CSS and javascript I have honed my skills in web develpoment by learning through the development and depolyment all on my own since 2017  </p>
			<p>I could say this website one of the proof of learning but more can be opt on down, <a href="https://github.com/Dilan-16/">check it out please</a> </p>
			
			<header class="major">
			<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
		</header>
			<p>Due to financial constraint I mostly relied on the free trial and learned most of the cloud on the specific period of time with specific cloud services that met the requirements of my projects. </p>
			<h3>Personal Virtual Private Network</h3>
			<p>As you may know VPN works by establishing a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, Here we are not relaying on any third party VPN provider as we are creating a remote server on our own by cloud computing services. </p>
			<p><u>WORKING</u> : For starters we are cretaing an Virtual machine on the Cloud server, it is called EC2 Instance in AWS. Through we generate a key pair for SSH access. </p>
			<p>Now for the big part we are using the Opensource OpenVPN which creates a secure tunnel for data traffic to pass between the VPN client and server. Which makes its accessible so easy. </p>
			<p>I've documented the entire process in a blog post which can be found in my <a href="https://hunterblog.netlify.app/post/openvpn/">blog.</a></p>
			
			<header class="major">
			<h2>Operating System</h2></header>
			<h3>Smart Watch Open source OS - Project Kaizen</h3>
			<p>This project has been on my mind for a long time, and I'm still experimenting with various aspects of it, ranging from kernel development to firmware connections to building an operating system. </p>
			<p>As everyone knows, Apple, Google, and Samsung dominate the smartwatch industry. One of the key factors contributing to their success in the wearables market is the wide variety of options they offer in their watch operating systems. These OSs are optimized to deliver fast and accurate results on relatively limited hardware, particularly in terms of health-related functionalities. Which ranges from offering all health related options on a small system which is more optimized to work as fast and give accurated results on less likely hardware. </p>
			<p>The answer depends on the perfection of stuff they are doing is mainly because of the R&D which makes all of this possible. But what they are doing is mostly closed source work as we never know the architecture on which the OS is built upon. This project which is an open source of building the OS with the ground architecture from building a customizable kernel to designing the user interface to deploying the apps to it. </p>

						<h2>More</h2>
						<p>I have a great passion for writing as well. I occasionally keep journals to organize my thoughts, but beyond that, I delve into various content types. Whether it's short stories, movie reviews, or TV show critiques, I cover a wide range of topics. You should definitely check out my blogs.</p>
