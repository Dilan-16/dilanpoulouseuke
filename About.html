            <p>When you spend years trying to figure out the meaning in every little things or logic for every happenings. As in philosphy turning over the pages of so called books of seneca, Nitche, Epictitus or even dostoskey for psychology, Grinding over and over again on philosopies for the best way to live and breath in this life,<span class="image right"><img src="images/FXSaRjpWYAEuRMu.jpg" alt="" /></span>  only to find out the answer was in one of the first cartoon you ever watched Dragon Ball: </p><u>Work well, Study well, Play well, Eat well, Rest well</u> <br><p>And you see that's the Turtle Master Roshi's way and I took it so serious in my life.</p>
            <span class="image left"><img src="images/tumblr_inline_pko2c01IOg1r15usg_640.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p>Which made me Learn stuff and Make stuff, that is all I do as the most exciting thing anyone can do is show the ropes of how they did what they did with the knowledge gained. I go out learn stuff which facinates me, I ask doubts to everyone on the field even if it's offline or online reddit community, When I feel like I learned something on one field I do something on that field and move onto next just as the Oppenheimer said "Theory Will Take You Only So Far" So it's always the learn something and make something for me. There are lot of resource in this world make you gain knowledge, so out of interest what catches my eye I learn through the diffrent of source formats such as from blog posts to videos to podcast to some random comment on online community platform explaining how it's done.</p>
            <p>Now that study well and work well is over, Play well is all about doing something which is non technical with your life such as hobbies. I do most of the boring things as fun <span class="image right"><img src="images/6M6cru.gif" alt=""></span> which other people see it as boring, I read novels(expecially Sci-fi but I read more diffrent genres too), learn History of diffrent heroes. As of the fun things on account of other opinions I watch Movies and Tv shows even I write reviews about them in my Letterbox account. I swim and ride bike for the physical activity which keeps the mind in order.</p> 
            <p>As of everyone have been in love with their rest as I am too, sleep. rest are the most human thing everyone do in their life without any motivation or reading philosopies. There is no understanding or finding meaning in sleep,<span class="image left"><img src="/images/guts_from_berserk_sleeping__by_unsearcheduser_der0mtd-fullview.webp" alt=""></span> it's just sleep. On another hand Eating the right food keeps you health and that's what I do and maybe you should too. </p>
            <p>That's all about me and these stuff are the basic routine of my life. </p>
